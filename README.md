**Pipe Bridge - Schematic Diagram Processing Service** – Batch process schematic diagrams in seconds using a cloud based computer vision system. Engineers can be more productive as they no longer need to spend hours identifing and counting symbols on schematic diagrams. This enables your engineering team to focus on more technical challenges and not adminstrative tasks.

The Schematic Diagram Processing Service uses new event-driven compute services, like AWS Lambda to provide a scaleable and rapid response.  It's an on-line tool, providing symbol matching, bill of material (BOM) generation and best practices for consisntently analysing schematic diagrams.
